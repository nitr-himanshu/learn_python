# Python

Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

It was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s at the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

## History

Version 1.0 was released in 1994.  
January 1, 2020 is End of life for Python 2.

## Python is Interpreted

Before jumping to python let's take a quick look into compiled language vs interpreter language.

Compiled language | Interpreted language
---|---
the source code is compiled into machine code before it is executed. | source code is executed directly by an interpreter, without being compiled
compiled code is optimized for the specific hardware and operating system | Less or no optimization
tend to be faster than interpreted languages | slower than compiled code
compiled code is less portable | more portable
More development / debug time | Faster development / debug
Ex : C, C++, Java, Swift | Ex : Python, Ruby, and JavaScript

Hence, development with python is faster and portable.
