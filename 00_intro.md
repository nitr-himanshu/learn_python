# Python : Introduction

Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

It was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s at the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:

- Machine Learning
- GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
- Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
- Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
- Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- Test frameworks
- Multimedia
- Scientific computing
- Text processing and many more..

## Pros and cons

### Pros

- Easy to read, write and learn
- Open source and large community
- User friendly data structures
- Dynamically typed (no need to mention data type)
- both OOP and procedural
- portable
- extensive library support

### Cons

- Performance : much slower than C or CPP
- Global interpreter lock (GIL) : GIL is a mechanism in python that prevents multiple threads from executing python code at once. It limits parallelism and concurrency.
- Memory consumption
- Dynamic typed : Data type can be changed at runtime.
- Lack of strictness

## History

Version 1.0 was released in 1994.  
January 1, 2020 is End of life for Python 2.

## Python is Interpreted

Before jumping to python let's take a quick look into compiled language vs interpreter language.

Compiled language | Interpreted language
---|---
the source code is compiled into machine code before it is executed. | source code is executed directly by an interpreter, without being compiled
compiled code is optimized for the specific hardware and operating system | Less or no optimization
tend to be faster than interpreted languages | slower than compiled code
compiled code is less portable | more portable
More development / debug time | Faster development / debug
Ex : C, C++, Java, Swift | Ex : Python, Ruby, and JavaScript

Hence, development with python is faster and portable.

## Setup

### Python 3.11.4

- https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/

### Anaconda 2.5.0

https://www.anaconda.com/download

## Key points

### Indentation

- Unlike other programming language, indentation in python is mandatory.
- A block is highlighted using indentation in python.
- Do not mix indentation using spaces or tabs.

### Comment

- Single-line comment using hash symbol (#)
- Multi-line comment using triple quotes(""")

### Docstring

- Comment to show the programs work.
